# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction App

## Overview

This project is an application built for stock market analysis and prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It utilizes the yfinance library to fetch historical stock data and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application with visualizations.

## Features

- **Stock Data Retrieval:** Utilizes the yfinance library to fetch historical stock data for analysis.
- **LSTM Model:** Employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for stock market prediction.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Built using Streamlit, enabling users to explore and visualize stock market data dynamically.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-analysis-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd stock-analysis-app
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

3. Use the interactive controls to select the stock, specify analysis parameters, and visualize the results.
